    <p>The conflict in Southern Cameroons escalated in 2017, after the government of Cameroon brutally suppressed protests by teachers and lawyers from English-Speaking Southern Cameroons. A popular uprising in October 2016 fueled by pro-independence groups decrying persecution of minority English speaking populations by the majority French speaking elites led to a brutal crack-down, mass arrests, torture, maiming and mass incarceration of Southern Cameroonians by government security forces. After self-defense groups sprung up to defend their communities, the government of Cameroon declared war on Southern Cameronians on November 1, 2017.</p>
    
    <p>In March 2020, the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) classified the conflict in Southern Cameroon as the most underreported conflict in the world for the second year in a row. Since 2017, an estimated 30,000 people have been killed and more than 1.2 million displaced within the conflict zones. Furthermore, over 400 villages and communities have been burnt to the ground and an estimated 3000 people arrested, tortured, detained, or disappeared by government security forces of La Republique du Cameroun with over 120,000 seeking refuge in Nigeria, Ghana and further afield, including Europe, the US and Canada.</p>
    
    <p>Amba Farmers Voice (AFV) was founded in 2020 in the US State of Virginia to identify practical ways to quickly educate the refugees and internally displaced persons via TV and Videos to reduce the fast growing humanitarian challenges brought about by the war. It is incorporated as a 501c (3) not-for-profit corporation.</p>
